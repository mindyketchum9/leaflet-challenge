# leaflet-challenge

Steps I took:


Used both **html** and **Javascript** to run analysis and visualize an earthquake data set.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 
I visited the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page 
and picked a data set to visualize. Used the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.

Imported & Visualized the Data.

Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.
